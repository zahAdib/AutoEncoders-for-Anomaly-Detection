# AutoEncoders for Anomaly Detection
In this project, we focused on anomaly detection using an Autoencoder. The Autoencoder was trained on normal data to learn its patterns and reconstruct it with minimal error.

# What is anamoly detection?
The process of finding patterns in data that do not conform to a model of normal behavior.  These unexpected patterns are referred to as anomalies or outliers. Anomalies may indicate errors or fraud in the data, or they may represent unusual or interesting phenomena that warrant further investigation.

# Applications on Anomaly Detection:
Anomaly detection can be applied to a wide range of domains, including finance, cybersecurity, medical diagnosis, and predictive maintenance. 

# Methods for Anomaly Detection
There are many different methods for detecting anomalies, such as statistical approaches, clustering algorithms, and deep learning models. One popular method of deep learning for anomaly detection is using **Autoencoders**, which is the focus of this project.

# What is AutoEncoder? 
Autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture. The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a compressed representation of the input data by encoding the input into a lower-dimensional representation, and then decoding the representation back into the original input.

# Why to use Autoencoders?
Unsupervised Learning: They don’t need labeled data. They learn patterns directly from the data.
Dimensionality Reduction: They reduce the number of features while keeping important information.
Anomaly Detection: Autoencoders can recognize patterns in normal data. If they encounter data that doesn’t fit the pattern, they struggle to reconstruct it, meaning that there’s an anomaly.

# What are the components of Autoencoders?
1. **Encoder**: it takes the input data and compress it into a smaller representation. It applies several transformations (usually matrix operations and activation functions) to extract meaningful patterns from the data.
2. **Hidden Layer (Code)**: This is the heart of the autoencoder because it makes it useful for tasks like dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and data compression. It holds the compressed, lower-dimensional version of the input data. This layer also called the (bottleneck layer) because it forces the network to focus on the most important features of the data.  
3. **Decoder**: The decoder takes the compressed representation (the Code) and reconstructs it back into the original format or close as possible to it.  

# AutoEncoders in the context of Anomaly Detection
An autoencoder is trained to replicate its input as accurately as possible in its output, minimizing the difference between the input and the reconstructed output. This difference, known as reconstruction error, is a key factor in anomaly detection. During training, the autoencoder learns patterns from "normal" data. When tested on new data, the autoencoder performs well on data similar to the training set, producing low reconstruction errors. However, for anomalous data the autoencoder struggles to reconstruct them accurately, resulting in a higher reconstruction error. By setting a threshold for reconstruction error based on the normal data, we can detect anomalies: if the error exceeds the threshold, the input is flagged as an anomaly.
